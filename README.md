DMV GUI project with added functionality to show message box error when textbox "max weight" is empty. This is a caught expection.
Added functionality for copying text file to backup folder. New way of getting last entry in textfile, without hardcoding arrays.
Shortening the code, deleting unnecessary lines of code (lines: 34-40, 118, 121) , adding comments to all methods, lines 41-47 text file now has custom name (creation time) and is saved correctly to the backup folder.
